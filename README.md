# Patient Appointment Attendance

In this project we will provide some exploratory analysis on the `data/Medical Appointments.csv` data set.

We then ran experiments to find a machine learning model that could predict whether a patient would show up for an appointment

### The Notebooks

In the `notebooks/` folder there are five numbered notebooks.

1. `Preprocess` details our preprocessing of the raw dataset.
2. `Exploratory Analysis` details our exploratory analysis.
3. `Baselines` shows our initial baseline models and their performance.
4. `Refine Models` shows how we then performed hyperparameter optimisation on our best performing baslines.
5. `Final Model` contains the details of our final, best performing model and how the model performs.
